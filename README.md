# Raytracer

**Note: this project is currently unfinished. The sphere raytracer is perfectly functional, but the cube raytracer is not. I will return to this when I have time.**

This is an implementation of a ray tracer for spheres and cubes. I'm writing it so I can randomly generate spheres and non-axis aligned cubes so that I can feed it into a perceptron for classification.

This is a rewrite of a general polygonal raytracer that I built a long time ago.
